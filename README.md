# D-Link router remote control

###Desciription
This is a tool I built for self use, using the Mechanize gem (just for convenience, really). It allows to remotely control the default d-link routers that Bezeq provides.

Right now it provides only basic functionality: Block, unblock, reset, and list connected users.
